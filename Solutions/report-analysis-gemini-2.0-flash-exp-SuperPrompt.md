## About
This contract implements a simple lending protocol where a lender can create a loan, a borrower can borrow it by providing collateral (DAI), and the loan can be repaid or liquidated if defaulted. The contract aims to be a basic lending mechanism with functionality for loan creation, borrowing, repayment, and liquidation. It uses a fixed price for DAI in relation to ETH. The contract also uses `Ownable` and `ReentrancyGuard` to add authorization and protect against reentrancy attacks.

## Findings Severity breakdown
- Critical: 1
- High: 3
- Medium: 3
- Low: 2
- Gas: 2

### Missing Initialization of Loan Properties
- **Title:** Missing Initialization of Loan Properties
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Description:** The `createLoan()` function does not correctly initialize the `startTime` and `dueDate` properties of the `activeLoan` struct when a new loan is created. It sets them to 0, which is not the intended logic. The intended logic is to set these when the loan is borrowed, and the logic uses this initial 0 value to calculate `isDefaulted` incorrectly.
- **Impact:** The `canLiquidate()` function relies on `activeLoan.startTime` and `activeLoan.dueDate` to determine if a loan is defaulted. Because these are initially zero and not updated when creating a loan, loans can be liquidated immediately after being borrowed since `block.timestamp + activeLoan.dueDate > activeLoan.startTime` is true, leading to an immediate and incorrect liquidation of any newly borrowed loan.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:74 - 83, Contract.sol:111
- **Recommendation:** The `startTime` and `dueDate` properties should be set only when the loan is borrowed in the `borrowLoan()` function. Remove the zero initialization in the `createLoan()` function and set the initial state as inactive with all other values 0 or false to avoid an early access vulnerability.

---
### Incorrect Collateralization Calculation
- **Title:** Incorrect Collateralization Calculation
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** The collateralization calculation in the `borrowLoan()` function is prone to precision loss. The intermediate result `collateralValue = collateralAmount * DAI_PRICE` is prone to integer overflow and should be done after dividing with 1e18. It should also be multiplied by 100 to correctly derive the collateralValue based on the threshold. Additionally, it divides `collateralValue` by `1e18` again before comparing it to the required collateral leading to incorrect comparisons.
- **Impact:** The incorrect calculation leads to the `require(collateralValue >= requiredCollateral, "Insufficient collateral")` to be inaccurate. It can allow borrowers to borrow loans with insufficient collateral which could cause the lender to lose funds. A malicious borrower can manipulate `collateralAmount` to bypass the required collateral check, and cause the loan to be borrowed with insufficient collateral.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:94, Contract.sol:96
- **Recommendation:**  Modify the calculation to perform the division before the multiplication and apply the threshold multiplication as well. Modify `collateralValue` calculation as following: `uint256 collateralValue = (collateralAmount * 100) / 1e18 * DAI_PRICE;` to use an intermediate value to avoid any underflow and ensure proper collateral comparison.

---
### Incorrect Liquidate Logic
- **Title:** Incorrect Liquidate Logic
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:**  The `canLiquidate` method checks `block.timestamp + activeLoan.dueDate > activeLoan.startTime` to determine if a loan is defaulted. The correct logic is that it should be `block.timestamp > activeLoan.dueDate`, and also it calculates the collateralization value using integer division again at  Contract.sol:113, and this value is then used as the comparison to check the loan is defaulted.
- **Impact:** This logic would trigger the liquidation process if `block.timestamp` is greater than the loan due date. This can cause loans to be liquidated prematurely even if the collateral is sufficient. The incorrect collateral calculation also allows liquidation even if the collateral is sufficient and the loan has not defaulted.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:111, Contract.sol:113
- **Recommendation:** Fix the logic in `canLiquidate` function to use `block.timestamp > activeLoan.dueDate` instead of `block.timestamp + activeLoan.dueDate > activeLoan.startTime` to accurately check if the loan is overdue, also use the correct collateral calculation and check if the collater is less than the required collateral.

---
### Incorrect Repayment Logic
- **Title:** Incorrect Repayment Logic
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** The `repayLoan` function increments the lenderBalance using the msg.value, even though the repayment amount should be equivalent to the active loan amount. This could lead to an incorrect lender balance if more is sent during repayment. Also the collateral should be sent to the borrower only after the repayment amount is checked.
- **Impact:**  It can cause an incorrect tracking of the lender balance, allowing the lender to withdraw more than expected. It also can allow an incorrect amount to be sent to the borrower during repayment.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:130, Contract.sol:133
- **Recommendation:** Ensure the `lenderBalance` is incremented only by `activeLoan.loanAmount`, not `msg.value`, and also that this is done after all the required checks. Also, transfer the collateral to the borrower after the repayment check.

---
### Lender Balance Incorrectly Updated
- **Title:** Lender Balance Incorrectly Updated
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** The `lenderBalance` is incremented by msg.value in createLoan and `msg.value` in the `repayLoan` function when it should be incremented by loan amount. The withdrawBalance function also does not check if a loan is borrowed or not.
- **Impact:** This incorrect update to `lenderBalance` will cause incorrect withdrawal amounts and lead to potential loss of funds from the contract. Inconsistent bookkeeping on the lender balance will cause issues when the `withdrawBalance` method is used.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:80, Contract.sol:130, Contract.sol:142
- **Recommendation:** Update the `lenderBalance` only by the loan amount and not by the value sent from the msg.value. The `withdrawBalance` function should also make sure that a loan is not active and borrowed before initiating the transfer of balance to the lender.

---
### Potential Front Running in setBorrower/setLender
- **Title:** Potential Front Running in setBorrower/setLender
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** The `setBorrower` and `setLender` functions are only protected by the `Ownable` modifier. It is possible that a new borrower or lender could be set by the contract owner and have the new address front run the next action that uses a specific address.
- **Impact:** An attacker who observes a transaction setting the lender or borrower address can front-run a transaction before it using the new address to bypass access control checks. This is especially harmful when a new malicious borrower is set who can then initiate an attack in the following transaction.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:49, Contract.sol:55
- **Recommendation:** Make sure that after the lender and borrower address is set, the loan contract is also properly updated so that no potential front running on the addresses can happen. This could also include temporarily locking the borrower and lender addresses from being updated during a loan cycle, or having the addresses be updated in conjunction with the loan state.

---
### Missing Zero Address Check in Withdraw
- **Title:** Missing Zero Address Check in Withdraw
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** The `withdrawBalance` function does not check if the lender address is zero before initiating the transfer of funds.
- **Impact:** If the lender address is set as address zero, then the funds will be transferred to address zero, which is lost forever.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:149
- **Recommendation:** Verify that the `lender` address is not `address(0)` before the withdraw function initiates the transfer of funds to avoid any loss of funds.

---
### Unused Modifier in Withdraw
- **Title:** Unused Modifier in Withdraw
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The `nonReentrant` modifier is used in the `withdrawBalance` function however, the function does not make an external call, and is only used to perform an internal balance transfer operation, hence the modifier is not required here.
- **Impact:** The `nonReentrant` modifier adds unnecessary gas costs and does not provide any benefit to the function.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:142
- **Recommendation:** The `nonReentrant` modifier can be safely removed from the `withdrawBalance` function to save gas costs.

---
###  Use of Block Timestamp for Loan Duration
- **Title:** Use of Block Timestamp for Loan Duration
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The contract uses `block.timestamp` to calculate loan duration and determine if a loan is defaulted. The timestamp is not guaranteed to be constant or accurate across all nodes due to block author manipulation and different block propagation times, and could be inaccurate by +- 15 seconds.
- **Impact:** There might be a small window where the loan could be liquidated or incorrectly determined as defaulted due to timestamp variations, although the chance of this is low.
- **Location:** Contract.sol:102, Contract.sol:111
- **Recommendation:** While it is a difficult problem to solve with the current L1 Ethereum mechanism, this should be documented to make sure that the users of the contract are aware of this risk. Try to use the block.number as the determining factor for loan durations.

---
### Gas Optimization: Division before Multiplication
- **Title:** Gas Optimization: Division before Multiplication
- **Severity:** Gas
- **Description:** In multiple places, the contract performs multiplication before division, which can lead to intermediate values that require more gas to compute. This is the case with the calculation of collateralValue in `borrowLoan`.
- **Impact:** Unnecessary gas costs
- **Location:** Contract.sol:94
- **Recommendation:** Perform division before multiplication to avoid large intermediate values. The correct calculation of collateral value should be `uint256 collateralValue = (collateralAmount * 100) / 1e18 * DAI_PRICE;`

---
### Gas Optimization: Caching Loan Struct
- **Title:** Gas Optimization: Caching Loan Struct
- **Severity:** Gas
- **Description:** The contract accesses the `activeLoan` struct multiple times within the `borrowLoan`, `canLiquidate`, and `liquidate` functions. Caching it in memory could reduce gas costs.
- **Impact:** Unnecessary gas costs due to storage reads
- **Location:** Contract.sol:90, Contract.sol:109, Contract.sol:121
- **Recommendation:** Cache the `activeLoan` struct in memory within functions that use it multiple times to avoid repeated storage reads.

## Detailed Analysis
- **Architecture:**
  The contract is structured as a lending protocol that manages a single active loan at a time. It has functionalities to create, borrow, repay, and liquidate loans. The main components are a lender and borrower addresses, loan state tracking using the Loan struct, and functions to execute loan operations. It is using a fixed ETH/DAI price. The contract depends on the ERC20 standard for DAI and uses `SafeERC20` for token transfers.
- **Code Quality:**
  The contract uses modifiers `onlyLender` and `onlyBorrower` to enforce authorization on critical functions. It also uses `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks. The code is relatively well-organized, although there are several logic and security flaws. There are not too many code comments in the contract which can be improved. There are issues with incorrect state updates and insufficient validations.
- **Centralization Risks:**
  The owner can set the `lender` and `borrower`, which can be a centralization point if the owner is malicious, or the keys are compromised. This requires the owner to be trustworthy. The owner can make the lender/borrower address as address zero, leading to funds being sent to address zero during the `withdrawBalance` operation which will lead to the loss of the funds.
- **Systemic Risks:**
  The contract relies on external `SafeERC20` library which can introduce risk if the library itself has vulnerabilities. The contract uses block timestamp for loan duration calculation, which is potentially unreliable due to block author manipulation.  It also does not account for cases where the ETH transfer fails within the borrow/withdraw methods.
- **Testing & Verification:**
The contract would benefit from more thorough testing, especially to capture edge cases and negative scenarios, like the ones mentioned in the vulnerability analysis. The current code will also fail due to integer overflows if there are large values that are used for `collateralAmount`, `DAI_PRICE` or `activeLoan.loanAmount` and this should be addressed. The contract lacks thorough tests to check for reentrancy or manipulation of the timestamp values.

## Final Recommendations
1. **Correct Loan Initialization:** Initialize `startTime` and `dueDate` only when the loan is borrowed.
2. **Fix Collateral Calculation:** Correct the collateral calculation in `borrowLoan` to prevent precision loss and ensure correct collateral requirements. Use the calculation: `uint256 collateralValue = (collateralAmount * 100) / 1e18 * DAI_PRICE;`
3. **Fix Liquidation Logic:** Update `canLiquidate` function to check `block.timestamp > activeLoan.dueDate` and `collateralValue < requiredCollateral`.
4. **Correct Repayment Logic:** Update `repayLoan` to increment `lenderBalance` only with the actual loan amount and transfer collateral after the check.
5. **Address Lender Balance Issues:** Correct updates to the `lenderBalance` in `createLoan` and `repayLoan`.
6. **Mitigate Front-Running Risks:** Implement more robust checks on `setBorrower` and `setLender` to avoid any kind of front-running issues.
7. **Add Zero Address Check:** Add checks in the `withdrawBalance` to prevent funds from being sent to zero address.
8. **Remove Unnecessary Modifier:** Remove the `nonReentrant` modifier in `withdrawBalance`.
9. **Document Timestamp Risk:** Document the timestamp risks for loan durations.
10. **Optimize Gas Usage:** Implement gas optimizations by calculating the division before the multiplication, and caching `activeLoan` struct.
11. **Add more detailed Test cases:** To make sure the code works and is not vulnerable to any attacks that are mentioned in this analysis, add more detailed test cases.
